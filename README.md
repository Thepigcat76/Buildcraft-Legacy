## About

This project, originally created for Modfest 2024, is an attempt at porting Buildcraft, step-by-step. This is why the mod only has a handful of features right now, but will be expanded gradually. The mod is not a 1:1 replica of the Buildcraft mod, but still very faithful. I decided to also include features from other old mods, that people used a lot with buildcraft like the Factorization Barrels.

The mod is still in its early stages and prone to bugs.

## Roadmap

For anyone interested, here is a rough content roadmap:

- Item Pipes, Crates, Tanks, Oil - Initial Release
- Engines (Redstone, Stirling, Combustion, Creative) < Current
- Pump/Quarry
- Fluid Pipes
- Lasers
- Advanced filters
- ...

Note that there is no ETA for any of these features, as I maintain and develop a lot of mods, which means the time I have to work on this, may vary strongly.

If you are interested in helping out, dont hesitate do submit a pr for a feature/bug-fix and join the Discord!
